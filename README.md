# ðŸŽ‰ Bonus Task: Power Up & Earn!

Earn $KOII by supporting new Tasks and mining KPL Tokens!

The Koii Foundation has allocated 50,000 KOII per day to reward participants who support new tokens.

## Why The Bonus?

When new projects and tokens launch on Koii, they need initial support until their tokens reach the market.

To help these new launches succeed and ensure developers get immediate access to a robust network of nodes, the bonus task provides additional $KOII rewards on top of the standard rewards from new tasks.

## Which Tasks are Eligible?

Run these tasks to earn your bonus:
- Mask Social Feeds
- Free Fire Task
- Big Big Task
- Inflation Monitoring
- ArK: Dangerous Dave Task

We will soon incorporate voting to determine which tasks are eligible for the bonus. Make sure to keep your node staked on the Bonus Task to build up voting power - the longer you stake, the more voting power you'll accumulate.
