# 🎉 Bonus Task: Power Up & Earn!

Get $KOII when you support new Tasks and mine KPL Tokens!

The Koii Foundation has allocated 50,000 KOII per day to reward you when you support new tokens.

## Why The Bonus?

When new projects and tokens launch on Koii, they need a bit of a boost until their tokens hit the market.

In order to support these new launches, and make sure developers get access to lots of nodes right away, the bonus task will issue $KOII rewards on top of the normal rewards from new tasks.

## How it works?

1. Once you run the task, it will pop up a voting page. (Note: if the page doesn't show up or you change your mind, please mannuly go to [localhost:30017/task/`<taskId>`/koii-voting.html](http://localhost:30017/task/`<taskId>`/koii-voting.html))
2. You can vote top 3 tasks you want to support.
3. The final task weighting will be decided by the community vote.
4. The more you stake on the task in the task list, the more voting power you'll have.
5. Make sure to keep your node on and have submissions to get the bonus.
6. 1500 $KOII is distributed every round.
