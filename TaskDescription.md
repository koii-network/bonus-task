# ðŸŽ‰ Bonus Task: Power Up & Earn!

Get $KOII when you support new Tasks and mine KPL Tokens!

The Koii Foundation has allocated 50,000 KOII per day to reward you when you support new tokens.

## How do I get rewards?
Every time your node makes a submission on the listed tasks, youâ€™ll rack-up bonus rewards in $KOII from the Bonus Task!
- Task Execution â†’ The more work you contribute, the larger your share of the 500 KOII being distributed!
- Staking Participation â†’ The more KOII you stake on tasks, the more weight your contributions will carry!

## Why The Bonus?

When new projects and tokens launch on Koii, they need a bit of a boost until their tokens hit the market.

In order to support these new launches, and make sure developers get access to lots of nodes right away, the bonus task will issue $KOII rewards on top of the normal rewards from new tasks.

## Which Tasks are Eligible?

Run these tasks to earn your bonus:
- Free Fire Task
- Mask Social Feeds
- Astrolink Task
- Big Big Task
- Inflation Monitoring
- ArK: Dangerous Dave Task

We will soon incorporate voting to determine which tasks are eligible for the bonus, so be sure to keep your node staked on the Bonus Task to build up voting power. The longer you stake, the more voting power you'll have.
