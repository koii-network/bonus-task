# ðŸŽ‰ Bonus Task: Power Up & Earn!

Get $KOII when you support new Tasks and mine KPL Tokens!

The Koii Foundation has allocated 50,000 KOII per day to reward you when you support new tokens.

## Why The Bonus?

When new projects and tokens launch on Koii, they need a bit of a boost until their tokens hit the market.

In order to support these new launches, and make sure developers get access to lots of nodes right away, the bonus task will issue $KOII rewards on top of the normal rewards from new tasks.

## How it works?

1. Once you run the task, a voting page will pop up in your browser window. (Note: if the page doesn't show up visit [localhost:30017/task/`<taskId>`/koii-voting.html](http://localhost:30017/task/`<taskId>`/koii-voting.html) in your browser) ðŸš€
2. Vote for the top three tasks you want to support ðŸ™Œ
3. The final task weighting will be decided by overall community votes
4. The more you stake on the task in the task list, the more voting power you'll have ðŸ’ª
5. Make sure to keep your node on to get the bonus ðŸ“ˆ
6. 1500 $KOII are distributed every round (that's 50k $KOII per day ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘)
