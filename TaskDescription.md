# ðŸŽ‰ Bonus Task: Power Up & Earn!

We've worked tirelessly as a team to bring the Koii Token to life, and now it's time to push forward toward a stable, thriving network! ðŸš€

## Why This Bonus?

- Your node powers the network, and we see your effort!
- This is our way of rewarding your consistencyâ€”a little treat for keeping things running smoothly.
- Exciting updates are on the horizon, and your role is key!

## How to Earn?

âœ… Keep your node online  
âœ… Stay active, support the network  
âœ… Claim your bonusâ€”it's that simple!

## How it works

Rewards are distributed based on your node's weight in the network:
- **Task Participation**: Each successful task execution increases your weight
- **Stake Amount**: Your staked KOII tokens contribute to your weight

**Reward Distribution**: 500 KOII are distributed every 15 minutes to all participating nodes proportionally to their weights. The higher your weight (from participation and stake), the larger share of the 500 KOII reward you'll receive.

This weight-based system ensures fair distribution based on both your active participation and network commitment.

Let's elevate to the moon together! ðŸŒ•ðŸš€
