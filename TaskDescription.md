# ðŸŽ‰ Bonus Task: Power Up & Earn!

We've worked tirelessly as a team to bring the Koii Token to life, and now it's time to push forward toward a stable, thriving network! ðŸš€

## Why The Bonus?

- Your node powers the network, and we see your effort!
- This is our way of rewarding your consistencyâ€”a small treat for keeping things running smoothly.
- Exciting updates are on the horizon, and your role is crucial!

## How to Earn?

âœ… Keep your node online  
âœ… Stay active and support the network
âœ… Claim your bonusâ€”it's that simple!

## How It Works

Rewards are distributed based on your node's weight in the network:
- **Task Participation**: Each successful task execution increases your weight.
- **Stake Amount**: Your staked KOII tokens contribute to your weight.

**Reward Distribution**: 500 KOII are distributed every 15 minutes to all participating nodes in proportion to their weights. The higher your weight (from participation and stake), the larger your share of the 500 KOII reward will be.

This weight-based system ensures a fair distribution based on both your active participation and network commitment.

Let's shoot for the moon together! ðŸŒ•ðŸš€
